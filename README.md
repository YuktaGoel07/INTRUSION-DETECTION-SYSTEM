#  Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A GUI-based Intrusion Detection System developed using Python, SQLite, and basic machine learning concepts. This project aims to detect abnormal or potentially malicious activities in a simulated environment and alert the user through a graphical interface.



##  Project Objective

- Detect potential intrusions and anomalies in real-time.
- Visualize detection logs and events through a user-friendly GUI.
- Store activity and alert data in a lightweight local database (SQLite).
- Optionally integrate basic ML logic for learning patterns in network behavior.



##  Features

-  Real-time packet simulation and status updates  
-  Alert system for suspicious activity  
-  Visual representation of logs (using Matplotlib)  
- SQLite integration for log storage  
-  Intuitive GUI using Tkinter  
-  Threading
